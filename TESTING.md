## üêõ Found an Issue?

If anything doesn't work as expected:

1. **Check installation logs** - Did `install.sh` show any errors?

3. **Terminal restart** - Close and reopen Terminal
4. **Path issues** - Make sure you're in the vault directory

**Common Fixes:**
```bash
# Re-run installation
./install.sh

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x .scripts/*.sh .scripts/*.py

# Reload shell config
source ~/.zshrc

# Check LaunchAgent (macOS)
launchctl list | grep obsidian
```
